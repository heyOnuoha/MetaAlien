                                <p style="text-align: left;">The Alien Purse will be used for various purposes, decided by Meta Alien holders. We will be able to specifically use these funds to sweep up the floor of Meta Aliens, acquire specific NFTs, support other artists in the space, fund community ideas that benefit our project, and so on.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We will also have a Reserve in place (a % of sales) to make sure that the project can be self-sustained. The Alien Purse will also be refilled from this Reserve when needed.<br />
